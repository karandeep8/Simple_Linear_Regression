# Simple_Linear_Regression
y = b0 + b1X1

y is the dependent variable that we are going to predict.

X1 is the independent variable which is the predictor.

b0 is the constant.

b1 is the slope coffecient.


Example:-

We are going to use the Simple Linear Regression to predict the output of potatoes on a fram on the basis of the amount of fertilizer used on the farm.

Potatoes[t] = b0 + b1*fertilizer[kg]

Understanding the Dataset

Our dataset is containing 30 obersvations.

And two columns:

Where one of the coulmn is representing YearsExperince.(Independent Variable).

And second column is representing the salary(Dependent Variable).

The problem we have to solve:

Our model has to understand the correlation between the dependent and independent variable. So that it can predict the salary for the new employee on the basis of it's year of Experince.
